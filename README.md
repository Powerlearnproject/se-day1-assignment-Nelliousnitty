#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The Development of Programming Languages – The introduction of early programming languages like Fortran (1957) and C (1972) revolutionized software development by providing more efficient and structured ways to write code, making programming more accessible and scalable.

The Establishment of Software Engineering as a Discipline (1960s) – In response to the "software crisis," the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference formally recognized software engineering as a distinct discipline, emphasizing systematic development processes to improve software quality and reliability.

The Advent of Structured Programming (1970s) and the Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s) – Structured programming introduced logical control structures to improve code readability and maintainability, while Agile methodologies later emerged to enhance flexibility and collaboration in software development, promoting iterative and user-centered approaches.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology	

Sequential, structured process with defined phases
Rigid, changes are difficult to implement once the process starts	
Limited customer involvement after initial requirements	
The final product is delivered at the end of the development cycle	
Best for well-defined projects with stable requirements	
Testing	Performed at the end of development	

Example of Scenarios
Developing a banking system that requires strict compliance, extensive documentation, and minimal changes after requirements are set.
Aerospace or healthcare software where safety and compliance standards demand a structured, sequential approach.
Government contracts where scope and requirements are clearly defined, and changes are not expected.

Agile Methodology 

Iterative and incremental development
Highly flexible, allows changes and continuous improvements
Frequent customer feedback and collaboration
Work is delivered in smaller, usable increments (sprints)
Best for dynamic projects with evolving requirements
Continuous testing throughout development

Example of Scenarios
A mobile app startup that continuously evolves based on user feedback and market trends.
An e-commerce website that needs regular updates, new features, and improvements.
AI and machine learning systems where requirements change based on data and user needs.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - Responsible for writing code, implementing software solutions, debugging issues, and collaborating with the team to build functional applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans, identifying defects, and verifying that the software meets user and industry standards.
Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects, managing timelines, resources, risks, and communication between stakeholders.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
-Use Agile Methodologies to accommodate changes through iterative development.
-Maintain clear communication with stakeholders to set realistic expectations.
-Implement version control and documentation to track requirement changes.

Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
-Prioritize tasks using frameworks like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have).
-Break the project into manageable sprints for incremental delivery.
-Allocate time for testing and quality assurance to prevent defects.

Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
-Follow best coding practices and conduct regular code reviews.
-Refactor code periodically to improve efficiency and scalability.
-Invest in automated testing to detect and resolve issues early.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

-Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Importance: Ensures each module functions correctly before integration, reducing errors in later stages.

-Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
Importance: Identifies communication issues between components, ensuring smooth data flow and system stability.

-System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Importance: Validates the overall functionality, performance, and reliability of the software before deployment.

-Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance: Ensures that the final product aligns with user expectations and is ready for release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting well-structured inputs to effectively communicate with AI models, ensuring precise and relevant responses. 

Importance - Optimizing AI interactions, improving response accuracy, and reducing ambiguity.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt - "Tell me about Cancer"
Improved prompt - "Explain the causes, symptoms, and treatment options for lung cancer in simple terms."

The improved prompt is more effective because its:-
Clear: Specifies the type of cancer (lung cancer) instead of being too broad.
Specific: Focuses on key aspects (causes, symptoms, and treatments) rather than a general overview.
Concise: Directs the AI to provide structured and relevant information.
